A transmit-\\nter sends high frequency sound waves into the body,\\nwhere they bounce off the different tissues and organs to\\nproduce a distinctive pattern of echoes. A receiver\\n“hears” the returning echo pattern and forwards it to a\\ncomputer, which translates the data into an image on a\\ntelevision screen. Because ultrasound can distinguish\\nsubtle variations between soft, fluid-filled tissues, it is',\n",
       " 'particularly useful in providing diagnostic images of the\\nabdomen. Ultrasound can also be used in treatment.\\nPurpose\\nThe potential medical applications of ultrasound\\nwere first recognized in the 1940s as an outgrowth of the\\nsonar technology developed to detect submarines during\\nWorld War II. The first useful medical images were pro-\\nduced in the early 1950s, and, by 1965, ultrasound quali-\\nty had improved to the point that it came into general\\nmedical use. Improvements in the technology, applica-\\ntion, and interpretation of ultrasound continue. Its low\\ncost, versatility, safety and speed have brought it into the\\ntop drawer of medical imaging techniques.\\nWhile pelvic ultrasound is widely known and com-\\nmonly used for fetal monitoring during pregnancy ,\\nultrasound is also routinely used for general abdominal\\nimaging. It has great advantage over x-ray imaging tech-\\nnologies in that it does not damage tissues with ionizing\\nradiation. Ultrasound is also generally far better than',\n",
       " 'plain x rays at distinguishing the subtle variations of soft\\ntissue structures, and can be used in any of several\\nmodes, depending on the need at hand.\\nAs an imaging tool, abdominal ultrasound generally\\nis warranted for patients afflicted with: chronic or acute\\nabdominal pain; abdominal trauma; an obvious or sus-\\npected abdominal mass; symptoms of liver disease, pan-\\ncreatic disease, gallstones , spleen disease, kidney dis-\\nease and urinary blockage; or symptoms of an abdominal\\naortic aneurysm. Specifically:\\n• Abdominal pain. Whether acute or chronic, pain can\\nsignal a serious problem—from organ malfunction or\\ninjury to the presence of malignant growths. Ultrasound\\nscanning can help doctors quickly sort through poten-\\ntial causes when presented with general or ambiguous\\nsymptoms. All of the major abdominal organs can be\\nstudied for signs of disease that appear as changes in\\nsize, shape and internal structure.\\n• Abdominal trauma. After a serious accident, such as a',\n",
       " 'car crash or a fall, internal bleeding from injured\\nabdominal organs is often the most serious threat to\\nsurvival. Neither the injuries nor the bleeding are\\nimmediately apparent. Ultrasound is very useful as an\\ninitial scan when abdominal trauma is suspected, and it\\ncan be used to pinpoint the location, cause, and severity\\nof hemorrhaging. In the case of puncture wounds,f r o m\\na bullet for example, ultrasound can locate the foreign\\nobject and provide a preliminary survey of the damage.\\nThe easy portability and versatility of ultrasound tech-\\nnology has brought it into common emergency room\\nuse, and even into limited ambulance service.\\n• Abdominal mass. Abnormal growths—tumors, cysts,\\nabscesses, scar tissue and accessory organs—can be\\nA\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 1located and tentatively identified with ultrasound. In\\nparticular, potentially malignant solid tumors can be\\ndistinguished from benign fluid-filled cysts and',\n",
       " 'distinguished from benign fluid-filled cysts and\\nabscesses. Masses and malformations in any organ or\\npart of the abdomen can be found.\\n• Liver disease. The types and underlying causes of liver\\ndisease are numerous, though jaundice tends to be a\\ngeneral symptom. Ultrasound can differentiate between\\nmany of the types and causes of liver malfunction, and\\nis particularly good at identifying obstruction of the\\nbile ducts and cirrhosis , which is characterized by\\nabnormal fibrous growths and reduced blood flow.\\n• Pancreatic disease. Inflammation and malformation of\\nthe pancreas are readily identified by ultrasound, as are\\npancreatic stones (calculi), which can disrupt proper\\nfunctioning.\\n• Gallstones. Gallstones cause more hospital admissions\\nthan any other digestive malady. These calculi can\\ncause painful inflammation of the gallbladder and also\\nobstruct the bile ducts that carry digestive enzymes\\nfrom the gallbladder and liver to the intestines. Gall-',\n",
       " 'stones are readily identifiable with ultrasound.\\n• Spleen disease. The spleen is particularly prone to\\ninjury during abdominal trauma. It may also become\\npainfully inflamed when beset with infection or\\ncancer. These conditions also lend themselves well to\\nultrasonic inspection and diagnosis.\\n• Kidney disease. The kidneys are also prone to traumatic\\ninjury and are the organs most likely to form calculi,\\nwhich can block the flow of urine and cause blood poi-\\nsoning (uremia). A variety of diseases causing distinct\\nchanges in kidney morphology can also lead to com-\\nplete kidney failure. Ultrasound imaging has proven\\nextremely useful in diagnosing kidney disorders.\\n• Abdominal aortic aneurysm. This is a bulging weak\\nspot in the abdominal aorta, which supplies blood\\ndirectly from the heart to the entire lower body. These\\naneurysms are relatively common and increase in\\nprevalence with age. A burst aortic aneurysm is immi-\\nnently life-threatening. However, they can be readily',\n",
       " 'identified and monitored with ultrasound before acute\\ncomplications result.\\nUltrasound technology can also be used for treat-\\nment purposes, most frequently as a visual aid during\\nsurgical procedures—such as guiding needle placement\\nto drain fluid from a cyst, or to extract tumor cells for\\nbiopsy. Increasingly, direct therapeutic applications for\\nultrasound are being developed.\\nThe direct therapeutic value of ultrasonic waves lies\\nin their mechanical nature. They are shock waves, just like\\naudible sound, and vibrate the materials through which\\nthey pass. These vibrations are mild, virtually unnotice-\\nable at the frequencies and intensities used for imaging.\\nProperly focused however, high-intensity ultrasound can\\nbe used to heat and physically agitate targeted tissues.\\nHigh-intensity ultrasound is used routinely to treat\\nsoft tissue injuries, such as strains, tears and associated\\nscarring. The heating and agitation are believed to pro-',\n",
       " 'mote rapid healing through increased circulation.

M-\\nmode ultrasound has been put to particular use in\\nstudying heart motion.\\n• Doppler mode.

The prin-\\nciple is the same as that used in radar guns that measure\\nthe speed of a car on the highway.

Although D&X is high-\\nly controversial, some physicians argue that it has advan-\\ntages that make it a preferable procedure in some circum-\\nstances. One perceived advantage is that the fetus is\\nremoved largely intact, allowing for better evaluation and\\nautopsy of the fetus in cases of known fetal anomalies.',\n",
       " 'Intact removal of the fetus may also confer a lower risk\\nof puncturing the uterus or damaging the cervix. Another\\nperceived advantage is that D&X ends the pregnancy\\nwithout requiring the woman to go through labor, which\\nmay be less emotionally traumatic than other methods of\\nlate-term abortion. In addition, D&X may offer a lower\\ncost and shorter procedure time.\\nPrecautions\\nWomen considering D&X should be aware of the\\nhighly controversial nature of this procedure. A contro-\\nversy common to all late-term abortions is whether the\\nfetus is viable, or able to survive outside of the woman’s\\nbody. A specific area of controversy with D&X is that\\nfetal death does not occur until after most of the fetal\\nbody has exited the uterus. Several states have taken\\nlegal action to limit or ban D&X and many physicians\\nwho perform abortions do not perform D&X. This may\\nrestrict the availability of this procedure to women seek-\\ning late-term abortion.\\nDescription',\n",

Septic abscesses can occur any-\\nwhere in the body. Only a germ and the body’s immune\\nresponse are required. In response to the invading germ,\\nwhite blood cells gather at the infected site and begin\\nproducing chemicals called enzymes that attack the germ\\nby digesting it. These enzymes act like acid, killing the\\ngerms and breaking them down into small pieces that can\\nbe picked up by the circulation and eliminated from the\\nbody. Unfortunately, these chemicals also digest body',\n",
       " 'tissues. In most cases, the germ produces similar chemi-\\ncals. The result is a thick, yellow liquid—pus—contain-\\ning digested germs, digested tissue, white blood cells,\\nand enzymes.\\nAn abscess is the last stage of a tissue infection that\\nbegins with a process called inflammation. Initially, as\\nthe invading germ activates the body’s immune system,\\nseveral events occur:\\n• Blood flow to the area increases.\\n• The temperature of the area increases due to the\\nincreased blood supply.\\n• The area swells due to the accumulation of water, blood,\\nand other liquids.\\n• It turns red.\\n• It hurts, because of the irritation from the swelling and\\nthe chemical activity.\\nThese four signs—heat, swelling, redness, and pain—\\ncharacterize inflammation.\\nAs the process progresses, the tissue begins to turn\\nto liquid, and an abscess forms. It is the nature of an\\nabscess to spread as the chemical digestion liquefies\\nmore and more tissue. Furthermore, the spreading fol-',\n",

It most easily continues along beneath the skin\\nrather than working its way through the skin where it\\ncould drain its toxic contents. The contents of the abscess\\nalso leak into the general circulation and produce symp-\\ntoms just like any other infection. These include chills,\\nfever, aching, and general discomfort.\\nSterile abscesses are sometimes a milder form of the\\nsame process caused not by germs but by non-living irri-\\ntants such as drugs. If an injected drug like penicillin is\\nnot absorbed, it stays where it was injected and may\\ncause enough irritation to generate a sterile abscess—\\nsterile because there is no infection involved. Sterile\\nabscesses are quite likely to turn into hard, solid lumps as\\nthey scar, rather than remaining pockets of pus.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nMany different agents cause abscesses.

The injuries can include punching, kick-',\n",
       " 'ing, biting, burning, beating, or pulling the victim’s hair.\\nThe physical abuse inflicted on a child can result in\\nbruises , burns, poisoning , broken bones, and internal\\nhemorrhages. Physical assault against an adult primarily\\noccurs with women, usually in the form of domestic vio-\\nlence. It is estimated that approximately three million\\nchildren witness domestic violence every year.\\nSexual abuse of a child refers to sexual behavior\\nbetween an adult and child or between two children, one\\nof whom is dominant or significantly older. The sexual\\nbehaviors can include touching breasts, genitals, and but-\\ntocks; either dressed or undressed. The behavior can also\\ninclude exhibitionism, cunnilingus, fellatio, or penetra-\\ntion of the vagina or anus with sexual organs or objects.\\nPornographic photography is also used in sexual\\nabuse with children. Reported sex offenders are 97%\\nmale. Females are more often perpetrators in child-care\\nsettings, since children may confuse sexual abuse by a',\n",

Sexual abuse of daughters by stepfathers or\\nfathers is the most common form of incest.\\nSexual abuse can also take the form of rape. The\\nlegal definition of rape includes only slight penile pene-\\ntration in the victim’s outer vulva area. Complete erec-\\ntion and ejaculation are not necessary.

Children who have been physi-\\ncally abused tend to be more aggressive, angry, hostile,\\ndepressed, and have low self-esteem. Additionally, they\\nexhibit fear,anxiety, and nightmares. Severe psychological\\nproblems may result in suicidal behavior or posttraumatic\\nstress disorder. Physically abused children may complain\\nof physical illness even in the absence of a cause. They\\nmay also suffer from eating disorders and encopresis.

Perpetrators usu-\\nally sexually assault their victims to dominate, hurt, and\\ndebase them. It is common for physical and sexual vio-\\nlence to occur at the same time. A large percentage of sex-\\nually assaulted persons were also physically abused in the\\nform of punching, beating, or threatening the victim with\\na weapon such as a gun or knife. Usually males who are\\nhurt and humiliated tend to physical assault persons\\nwhom they are intimately involved with, such as spouses',\n",

Males who assault a female tend to have\\nexperienced or witnessed violence during childhood.\\nThey also tend to abuse alcohol, to be sexually assaultive,\\nand are at increased risk for assaultive behavior directed\\nagainst children. Jealous males tend to monitor the\\nwomen’s movements and whereabouts and to isolate\\nother sources of protection and support. They interpret\\ntheir behavior as betrayal of trust and this causes resent-\\nment and explosive anger outbursts during periods of los-\\ning control. Males may also use aggression against\\nfemales in an effort to control and intimidate partners.\\nAbuse in the elderly usually occurs in the frail, elderly\\ncommunity.

       " 'vents normal swallowing.\\nDescription\\nAchalasia affects the esophagus, the tube that carries\\nswallowed food from the back of the throat down into the\\nstomach. A ring of muscle called the lower esophageal\\nsphincter encircles the esophagus just above the entrance to\\nthe stomach. This sphincter muscle is normally contracted\\nto close the esophagus. When the sphincter is closed, the\\ncontents of the stomach cannot flow back into the esopha-\\ngus. Backward flow of stomach contents (reflux) can irri-\\ntate and inflame the esophagus, causing symptoms such as\\nheartburn. The act of swallowing causes a wave of\\nesophageal contraction called peristalsis. Peristalsis pushes\\nfood along the esophagus. Normally, peristalsis causes the\\nesophageal sphincter to relax and allow food into the stom-\\nach. In achalasia, which means “failure to relax,” the\\nesophageal sphincter remains contracted. Normal peristal-\\nsis is interrupted and food cannot enter the stomach.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCauses',\n",
       " 'Causes and symptoms\\nCauses\\nAchalasia is caused by degeneration of the nerve\\ncells that normally signal the brain to relax the\\nesophageal sphincter. The ultimate cause of this degener-\\nation is unknown. Autoimmune disease or hidden infec-\\ntion is suspected.\\nSymptoms\\nDysphagia, or difficulty swallowing, is the most com-\\nmon symptom of achalasia. The person with achalasia usu-\\nally has trouble swallowing both liquid and solid foods,\\noften feeling that food “gets stuck” on the way down. The\\nperson has chest pain that is often mistaken for angina\\npectoris (cardiac pain). Heartburn and difficulty belching\\nare common. Symptoms usually get steadily worse. Other\\nsymptoms may include nighttime cough or recurrent\\npneumoniacaused by food passing into the lower airways.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of achalasia begins with a careful medical\\nhistory. The history should focus on the timing of symp-\\ntoms and on eliminating other medical conditions that\\nmay cause similar symptoms. Tests used to diagnose',\n",
       " 'achalasia include:\\n• Esophageal manometry. In this test, a thin tube is\\npassed into the esophagus to measure the pressure\\nexerted by the esophageal sphincter.\\n• X ray of the esophagus. Barium may be swallowed to\\nact as a contrast agent. Barium reveals the outlines of\\nthe esophagus in greater detail and makes it easier to\\nsee its constriction at the sphincter.\\n• Endoscopy. In this test, a tube containing a lens and a\\nlight source is passed into the esophagus. Endoscopy is\\nused to look directly at the surface of the esophagus.\\nThis test can also detect tumors that cause symptoms\\nlike those of achalasia. Cancer of the esophagus occurs\\nas a complication of achalasia in 2-7% of patients.\\nTreatment\\nThe first-line treatment for achalasia is balloon dila-\\ntion. In this procedure, an inflatable membrane or bal-\\nloon is passed down the esophagus to the sphincter and\\ninflated to force the sphincter open. Dilation is effective\\nin about 70% of patients.',\n",

It occurs when the\\npores of the skin become clogged with oil, dead skin\\ncells, and bacteria.\\nDescription\\nAcne vulgaris, the medical term for common acne, is\\nthe most common skin disease. It affects nearly 17 million\\npeople in the United States. While acne can arise at any\\nage, it usually begins at puberty and worsens during ado-\\nlescence. Nearly 85% of people develop acne at some time\\nbetween the ages of 12-25 years. Up to 20% of women\\ndevelop mild acne. It is also found in some newborns.\\nThe sebaceous glands lie just beneath the skin’s sur-\\nface. They produce an oil called sebum, the skin’s natural\\nmoisturizer. These glands and the hair follicles within\\nwhich they are found are called sebaceous follicles.\\nThese follicles open onto the skin through pores. At',\n",
       " 'puberty, increased levels of androgens (male hormones)\\ncause the glands to produce too much sebum. When\\nexcess sebum combines with dead, sticky skin cells, a\\nhard plug, or comedo, forms that blocks the pore. Mild\\nnoninflammatory acne consists of the two types of come-\\ndones, whiteheads and blackheads.\\nModerate and severe inflammatory types of acne\\nresult after the plugged follicle is invaded by Propioni-\\nbacterium acnes , a bacteria that normally lives on the\\nskin. A pimple forms when the damaged follicle weakens\\nand bursts open, releasing sebum, bacteria, and skin and\\nwhite blood cells into the surrounding tissues. Inflamed\\npimples near the skin’s surface are called papules; when\\ndeeper, they are called pustules. The most severe type of\\nacne consists of cysts (closed sacs) and nodules (hard\\nswellings). Scarring occurs when new skin cells are laid\\ndown to replace damaged cells.\\nThe most common sites of acne are the face, chest,\\nshoulders, and back since these are the parts of the body',\n",
       " 'where the most sebaceous follicles are found.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe exact cause of acne is unknown. Several risk\\nfactors have been identified:\\n• Age. Due to the hormonal changes they experience,\\nteenagers are more likely to develop acne.\\n• Gender. Boys have more severe acne and develop it\\nmore often than girls.\\n• Disease. Hormonal disorders can complicate acne in\\ngirls.\\n• Heredity. Individuals with a family history of acne have\\ngreater susceptibility to the disease.\\n• Hormonal changes. Acne can flare up before menstrua-\\ntion, during pregnancy, and menopause.\\n• Diet. No foods cause acne, but certain foods may cause\\nflare-ups.\\n• Drugs. Acne can be a side effect of drugs including\\ntranquilizers, antidepressants, antibiotics, oral contra-\\nceptives, and anabolic steroids.\\n• Personal hygiene. Abrasive soaps, hard scrubbing, or\\npicking at pimples will make them worse.\\n• Cosmetics. Oil-based makeup and hair sprays worsen\\nacne.\\n• Environment. Exposure to oils and greases, polluted air,',\n",

Emotional stress may contribute to acne.\\nAcne is usually not conspicuous, although inflamed\\nlesions may cause pain, tenderness, itching, or swelling.\\nThe most troubling aspects of these lesions are the nega-\\ntive cosmetic effects and potential for scarring.

People possess two of each type of\\nvestibulocochlear nerve, one that extends from the left\\near and one that extends from the right ear.\\nThe vestibular nerve transmits information concern-\\ning balance from the inner ear to the brain and the cochlear\\nnerve transmits information about hearing. The vestibular\\nnerve, like many nerves, is surrounded by a cover called a\\nmyelin sheath. A tumor, called a schwannoma, can some-\\ntimes develop from the cells of the myelin sheath. A tumor\\nis an abnormal growth of tissue that results from the\\nuncontrolled growth of cells. Acoustic neuromas are often\\ncalled vestibular schwannomas because they are tumors\\nthat arise from the myelin sheath that surrounds the\\nvestibular nerve.

If the acoustic nerve grows large\\nenough to press against the cochlear nerve, then hearing\\nloss and a ringing (tinnitus) in the affected ear will usu-\\nally occur. If untreated and the acoustic neuroma contin-\\nues to grow it can press against other nerves in the region\\nand cause other symptoms. This tumor can be life threat-\\nening if it becomes large enough to press against and\\ninterfere with the functioning of the brain.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCauses\\nAn acoustic neuroma is caused by a change or\\nabsence of both of the NF2 tumor suppressor genes in a\\nnerve cell. Every person possesses a pair of NF2 genes in\\nevery cell of their body including their nerve cells. One\\nNF2 gene is inherited from the egg cell of the mother and\\none NF2 gene is inherited from the sperm cell of the\\nfather. The NF2 gene is responsible for helping to pre-\\nvent the formation of tumors in the nerve cells. In partic-',\n",

If both NF2 genes become changed or missing in\\none of the myelin sheath cells of the vestibular nerve\\nthen an acoustic neuroma will usually develop. Most uni-\\nlateral acoustic neuromas result when the NF2 genes\\nbecome spontaneously changed or missing. Someone\\nwith a unilateral acoustic neuroma that has developed\\nspontaneously is not at increased risk for having children\\nwith an acoustic neuroma. Some unilateral acoustic neu-\\nromas result from the hereditary condition NF2. It is also\\npossible that some unilateral acoustic neuromas may be\\ncaused by changes in other genes responsible for pre-\\nventing the formation of tumors.\\nBilateral acoustic neuromas result when someone is\\naffected with the hereditary condition NF2.

       " 'NF2 is typically born with one unchanged and one\\nchanged or missing NF2 gene in every cell of their body.\\nSometimes they inherit this change from their mother or\\nfather. Sometimes the change occurs spontaneously when\\nthe egg and sperm come together to form the first cell of\\nthe baby. The children of a person with NF2 have a 50%\\nchance of inheriting the changed or missing NF2 gene.\\nA person with NF2 will develop an acoustic neuro-\\nma if the remaining unchanged NF2 gene becomes spon-\\ntaneously changed or missing in one of the myelin sheath\\ncells of their vestibular nerve. People with NF2 often\\ndevelop acoustic neuromas at a younger age. The mean\\nage of onset of acoustic neuroma in NF2 is 31 years of\\nage versus 50 years of age for sporadic acoustic neuro-\\nmas. Not all people with NF2, however, develop acoustic\\nneuromas. People with NF2 are at increased risk for\\ndeveloping cataracts and tumors in other nerve cells.\\nMost people with a unilateral acoustic neuroma are',\n",
       " 'not affected with NF2. Some people with NF2, however,\\nonly develop a tumor in one of the vestibulocochlear\\nnerves. Others may initially be diagnosed with a unilater-\\nal tumor but may develop a tumor in the other nerve a\\nnumber of years later. NF2 should be considered in some-\\none under the age of 40 who has a unilateral acoustic neu-\\nroma. Someone with a unilateral acoustic neuroma and\\nother family members diagnosed with NF2 probably is\\naffected with NF2. Someone with a unilateral acoustic\\nneuroma and other symptoms of NF2 such as cataracts\\nand other tumors may also be affected with NF2. On the\\nother hand, someone over the age of 50 with a unilateral\\nacoustic neuroma, no other tumors and no family history\\nof NF2 is very unlikely to be affected with NF2.\\nSymptoms\\nSmall acoustic neuromas usually only interfere with\\nthe functioning of the vestibulocochlear nerve. The most\\ncommon first symptom of an acoustic neuroma is hearing\\nloss, which is often accompanied by a ringing sound (tin-',\n",

People with acoustic neuromas sometimes report\\ndifficulties in using the phone and difficulties in perceiving\\nthe tone of a musical instrument or sound even when their\\nhearing appears to be otherwise normal. In most cases the\\nhearing loss is initially subtle and worsens gradually over\\ntime until deafness occurs in the affected ear. In approxi-\\nmately 10% of cases the hearing loss is sudden and severe.\\nAcoustic neuromas can also affect the functioning of\\nthe vestibular branch of the vestibulocochlear nerve and\\nvan cause vertigo and dysequilibrium.

This chemical released from the pituitary gland\\nis called growth hormone (GH). The body’s ability to\\nKEY TERMS\\nSympathetic nerve —A nerve of the autonomic\\nnervous system that regulates involuntary and\\nautomatic reactions, especially to stress.\\nprocess and use nutrients like fats and sugars is also\\naltered. In children whose bony growth plates have not\\nclosed, the chemical changes of acromegaly result in\\nexceptional growth of long bones. This variant is called',\n",
       " 'gigantism, with the additional bone growth causing\\nunusual height. When the abnormality occurs after bone\\ngrowth stops, the disorder is called acromegaly.\\nDescription\\nAcromegaly is a relatively rare disorder, occurring in\\napproximately 50 out of every one million people (50/\\n1,000,000). Both men and women are affected. Because\\nthe symptoms of acromegaly occur so gradually, diagno-\\nsis is often delayed. The majority of patients are not\\nidentified until they are middle aged.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe pituitary is a small gland located at the base of\\nthe brain. A gland is a collection of cells that releases\\ncertain chemicals, or hormones, which are important to\\nthe functioning of other organs or body systems. The\\npituitary hormones travel throughout the body and are\\ninvolved in a large number of activities, including the\\nregulation of growth and reproductive functions. The\\ncause of acromegaly can be traced to the pituitary’s pro-\\nduction of GH.',\n",
       " 'duction of GH.\\nUnder normal conditions, the pituitary receives input\\nfrom another brain structure, the hypothalamus, located\\nat the base of the brain. This input from the hypothala-\\nmus regulates the pituitary’s release of hormones. For\\nexample, the hypothalamus produces growth hormone-\\nreleasing hormone (GHRH), which directs the pituitary\\nto release GH. Input from the hypothalamus should also\\ndirect the pituitary to stop releasing hormones.\\nIn acromegaly, the pituitary continues to release GH\\nand ignores signals from the hypothalamus. In the liver,\\nGH causes production of a hormone called insulin-like\\ngrowth factor 1 (IGF-1), which is responsible for growth\\nthroughout the body. When the pituitary refuses to stop\\nproducing GH, the levels of IGF-1 also reach abnormal\\npeaks. Bones, soft tissue, and organs throughout the body\\nbegin to enlarge, and the body changes its ability to\\nprocess and use nutrients like sugars and fats.\\nIn acromegaly, an individual’s hands and feet begin',\n",
       " 'to grow, becoming thick and doughy. The jaw line, nose,\\nand forehead also grow, and facial features are described\\nas “coarsening”. The tongue grows larger, and because\\nthe jaw is larger, the teeth become more widely spaced.\\nDue to swelling within the structures of the throat and\\nsinuses, the voice becomes deeper and sounds more hol-\\nlow, and patients may develop loud snoring. Various hor-\\nmonal changes cause symptoms such as:\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 232\\nAcromegaly and gigantism\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 32• heavy sweating\\n• oily skin\\n• increased coarse body hair\\n• improper processing of sugars in the diet (and some-\\ntimes actual diabetes)\\n• high blood pressure\\n• increased calcium in the urine (sometimes leading to\\nkidney stones)\\n• increased risk of gallstones; and\\n• swelling of the thyroid gland\\nPeople with acromegaly have more skin tags, or out-\\ngrowths of tissue, than normal. This increase in skin tags\\nis also associated with the development of growths,',\n",
       " 'called polyps, within the large intestine that may eventu-\\nally become cancerous. Patients with acromegaly often\\nsuffer from headaches and arthritis. The various\\nswellings and enlargements throughout the body may\\npress on nerves, causing sensations of local tingling or\\nburning, and sometimes result in muscle weakness.\\nThe most common cause of this disorder (in 90% of\\npatients) is the development of a noncancerous tumor with-\\nin the pituitary, called a pituitary adenoma. These tumors\\nare the source of the abnormal release of GH. As these\\ntumors grow, they may press on nearby structures within the\\nbrain, causing headaches and changes in vision. As the ade-\\nnoma grows, it may disrupt other pituitary tissue, interfering\\nwith the release of other hormones. These disruptions may\\nbe responsible for changes in the menstrual cycle of\\nwomen, decreases in the sexual drive in men and women,\\nand the abnormal production of breast milk in women. In',\n",
       " 'rare cases, acromegaly is caused by the abnormal produc-\\ntion of GHRH, which leads to the increased production of\\nGH. Certain tumors in the pancreas, lungs, adrenal glands,\\nthyroid, and intestine produce GHRH, which in turn triggers\\nproduction of an abnormal quantity of GH.\\nDiagnosis\\nBecause acromegaly produces slow changes over\\ntime, diagnosis is often significantly delayed. In fact, the\\ncharacteristic coarsening of the facial features is often\\nnot recognized by family members, friends, or long-time\\nfamily physicians. Often, the diagnosis is suspected by a\\nnew physician who sees the patient for the first time and\\nis struck by the patient’s characteristic facial appearance.\\nComparing old photographs from a number of different\\ntime periods will often increase suspicion of the disease.\\nBecause the quantity of GH produced varies widely\\nunder normal conditions, demonstrating high levels of\\nGH in the blood is not sufficient to merit a diagnosis of',\n",
       " 'acromegaly. Instead, laboratory tests measuring an\\nincrease of IGF-1 (3-10 times above the normal level) are\\nuseful. These results, however, must be carefully inter-\\npreted because normal laboratory values for IGF-1 vary\\nwhen the patient is pregnant, undergoing puberty, elder-\\nly, or severely malnourished. Normal patients will show a\\ndecrease in GH production when given a large dose of\\nsugar (glucose). Patients with acromegaly will not show\\nthis decrease, and will often show an increase in GH pro-\\nduction. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is useful\\nfor viewing the pituitary, and for identifying and locating\\nan adenoma.

Nearly all\\nof the forms of Oriental medicine that are used in the\\nWest today, including acupuncture, acupressure, shiatsu,\\nand Chinese herbal medicine, have their roots in Chinese\\nmedicine. One legend has it that acupuncture and acu-\\npressure evolved as early Chinese healers studied the\\npuncture wounds of Chinese warriors, noting that certain\\npoints on the body created interesting results when stim-\\nulated.

Chinese medicine does not\\ndraw a sharp line, as Western medicine does, between\\nmind and body. The Chinese system believes that emo-\\ntions and mental states are every bit as influential on dis-\\nease as purely physical mechanisms, and considers fac-\\ntors like work, environment, lifestyle and relationships as\\nfundamental to the overall picture of a patient’s health.\\nChinese medicine also uses very different symbols and',\n",
       " 'ideas to discuss the body and health. While Western med-\\nicine typically describes health in terms of measurable\\nphysical processes made up of chemical reactions, the\\nChinese use ideas like yin and yang, chi, the organ sys-\\ntem, and the five elements to describe health and the\\nbody. To understand the ideas behind acupuncture, it is\\nworthwhile to introduce some of these basic terms.\\nYIN AND YANG. According to Chinese philosophy,\\nthe universe and the body can be described by two sepa-\\nrate but complementary principles, that of yin and yang.\\nFor example, in temperature, yin is cold and yang is hot.\\nIn gender, yin is female and yang is male. In activity, yin\\nis passive and yang is active. In light, yin is dark and\\nyang is bright; in direction yin is inward and downward\\nand yang is outward and up, and so on.

Thus, acupuncture\\ntherapies seek to either increase or reduce yang, or\\nincrease or reduce yin in particular regions of the body.\\nCHI. Another fundamental concept of Chinese med-\\nicine is that of chi (pronounced chee, also spelled qi). Chi',\n",
       " 'is the fundamental life energy of the universe. It is invisi-\\nble and is found in the environment in the air, water, food\\nand sunlight. In the body, it is the invisible vital force\\nthat creates and animates life. We are all born with inher-\\nited amounts of chi, and we also get acquired chi from\\nthe food we eat and the air we breathe. The level and\\nquality of a person’s chi also depends on the state of\\nphysical, mental and emotional balance. Chi travels\\nthrough the body along channels called meridians.\\nTHE ORGAN SYSTEM. In the Chinese system, there\\nare twelve main organs: the lung, large intestine, stom-\\nach, spleen, heart, small intestine, urinary bladder, kid-\\nney, liver, gallbladder, pericardium, and the “triple\\nwarmer,” which represents the entire torso region.

These ele-\\nments are all interconnected, and each element either',\n",
       " 'generates or controls another element. For instance,\\nwater controls fire and earth generates metal. Each organ\\nis associated with one of the five elements. The Chinese\\nsystem uses elements and organs to describe and treat\\nconditions. For instance, the kidney is associated with\\nwater and the heart is associated with fire, and the two\\norgans are related as water and fire are related. If the kid-\\nney is weak, then there might be a corresponding fire\\nproblem in the heart, so treatment might be made by\\nacupuncture or herbs to cool the heart system and/or\\nincrease energy in the kidney system.\\nThe Chinese have developed an intricate system of\\nhow organs and elements are related to physical and\\nmental symptoms, and the above example is a very sim-\\nple one.

In Chi-\\nnese medicine, disease as seen as imbalances in the organ\\nsystem or chi meridians, and the goal of any remedy or\\ntreatment is to assist the body in reestablishing its innate\\nharmony. Disease can be caused by internal factors like\\nemotions, external factors like the environment and\\nweather, and other factors like injuries, trauma, diet, and\\ngerms. However, infection is seen not as primarily a\\nproblem with germs and viruses, but as a weakness in the\\nenergy of the body which is allowing a sickness to occur.\\nIn Chinese medicine, no two illnesses are ever the same,\\nas each body has its own characteristics of symptoms and\\nbalance.

Some points barely go beyond superficial\\nlayers of skin, while some acupuncture points require a\\ndepth of 1-3 in (2.5-7.5 cm) of needle. The needles general-\\nly do not cause pain. Patients sometimes report pinching\\nsensations and often pleasant sensations, as the body expe-\\nriences healing. Depending on the problem, the acupunc-\\nturist might spin or move the needles, or even pass a slight\\nelectrical current through some of them. Moxibustion may\\nbe sometimes used, in which an herbal mixture (moxa or\\nmugwort) is either burned like incense on the acupuncture\\npoint or on the end of the needle, which is believed to stim-\\nulate chi in a particular way.

This results in decreased production of two\\nimportant chemicals (hormones) normally released by\\nthe adrenal cortex: cortisol and aldosterone.\\nDescription\\nThe adrenals are two glands, each perched on the\\nupper part of the two kidneys. The outer part of the gland',\n",
       " 'is known as the cortex; the inner part is known as the\\nmedulla. Each of these parts of the adrenal gland is\\nresponsible for producing different types of hormones.\\nCortisol is a very potent hormone produced by the\\nadrenal cortex. It is involved in regulating the functioning\\nof nearly every type of organ and tissue throughout the\\nbody, and is considered to be one of the few hormones\\nabsolutely necessary for life. Cortisol is involved in:\\n• the very complex processing and utilization of many nutri-\\nents, including sugars (carbohydrates), fats, and proteins\\n• the normal functioning of the circulatory system and\\nthe heart\\nKEY TERMS\\nGland—A collection of cells whose function is to\\nrelease certain chemicals, or hormones, which are\\nimportant to the functioning of other, sometimes\\ndistantly located, organs or body systems.\\nHormone —A chemical produced in one part of\\nthe body, which travels to another part of the body\\nin order to exert its effect.\\n• the functioning of muscles',\n",
       " '• the functioning of muscles\\n• normal kidney function\\n• production of blood cells\\n• the normal processes involved in maintaining the skele-\\ntal system\\n• proper functioning of the brain and nerves\\n• the normal responses of the immune system\\nAldosterone, also produced by the adrenal cortex,\\nplays a central role in maintaining the appropriate pro-\\nportions of water and salts in the body. When this bal-\\nance is upset, the volume of blood circulating throughout\\nthe body will fall dangerously low, accompanied by a\\ndrop in blood pressure.\\nAddison’s disease is also called primary adrenocorti-\\ncal insufficiency. In other words, some process interferes\\ndirectly with the ability of the adrenal cortex to produce\\nits hormones. Levels of both cortisol and aldosterone\\ndrop, and numerous functions throughout the body are\\ndisrupted.\\nAddison’s disease occurs in about four in every\\n100,000 people. It strikes both men and women of all ages.\\nCauses and symptoms',\n",
       " 'Causes and symptoms\\nThe most common cause of Addison’s disease is the\\ndestruction and/or shrinking (atrophy) of the adrenal\\ncortex. In about 70% of all cases, this atrophy is\\nbelieved to occur due to an autoimmune disorder. In an\\nautoimmune disorder, the immune system of the body,\\nresponsible for identifying foreign invaders such as\\nviruses or bacteria and killing them, accidentally begins\\nto identify the cells of the adrenal cortex as foreign, and\\ndestroy them. In about 20% of all cases, destruction of\\nthe adrenal cortex is caused by tuberculosis . The\\nremaining cases of Addison’s disease may be caused by\\nfungal infections, such as histoplasmosis , coccidiomy-\\ncosis, and cryptococcosis , which affect the adrenal\\ngland by producing destructive, tumor-like masses\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 53\\nAddison’s disease\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 53called granulomas; a disease called amyloidosis ,i n\\nwhich a starchy substance called amyloid is deposited in',\n",

The most com-\\nmon symptoms include fatigue and loss of energy,\\ndecreased appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea ,\\nabdominal pain, weight loss, muscle weakness, dizzi-\\nness when standing, dehydration , unusual areas of\\ndarkened (pigmented) skin, and dark freckling. As the\\ndisease progresses, the patient may appear to have very\\ntanned, or bronzed skin, with darkening of the lining of\\nthe mouth, vagina, and rectum, and dark pigmentation\\nof the area around the nipples (aereola). As dehydration\\nbecomes more severe, the blood pressure will continue\\nto drop and the patient will feel increasingly weak and',\n",
       " 'light-headed. Some patients have psychiatric symp-\\ntoms, including depression and irritability. Women lose\\npubic and underarm hair, and stop having normal men-\\nstrual periods.\\nWhen a patient becomes ill with an infection, or\\nstressed by an injury, the disease may suddenly and\\nrapidly progress, becoming life-threatening. Symptoms\\nof this “Addisonian crisis” include abnormal heart\\nrhythms, severe pain in the back and abdomen, uncon-\\ntrollable nausea and vomiting , a drastic drop in blood\\npressure, kidney failure, and unconsciousness. About\\n25% of all Addison’s disease patients are identified due\\nto the development of Addisonian crisis.\\nDiagnosis\\nMany patients do not recognize the slow progres-\\nsion of symptoms and the disease is ultimately identified\\nwhen a physician notices the areas of increased pigmen-\\ntation of the skin. Once suspected, a number of blood\\ntests can lead to the diagnosis of Addison’s disease. It is\\nnot sufficient to demonstrate low blood cortisol levels,',\n",
       " 'as normal levels of cortisol vary quite widely. Instead,\\npatients are given a testing dose of another hormone\\ncalled corticotropin (ACTH). ACTH is produced in the\\nbody by the pituitary gland, and normally acts by pro-\\nmoting growth within the adrenal cortex and stimulating\\nthe production and release of cortisol. In Addison’s dis-\\nease, even a dose of synthetic ACTH does not increase\\ncortisol levels.\\nTo distinguish between primary adrenocortical\\ninsufficiency (Addison’s disease) and secondary\\nadrenocortical insufficiency (caused by failure of the\\npituitary to produce enough ACTH), levels of ACTH in\\nthe blood are examined. Normal or high levels of\\nACTH indicate that the pituitary is working properly,\\nbut the adrenal cortex is not responding normally to the\\npresence of ACTH. This confirms the diagnosis of\\nAddison’s disease.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment of Addison’s disease involves replacing\\nthe missing or low levels of cortisol. In the case of Addis-',\n",
       " 'onian crisis, this will be achieved by injecting a potent\\nform of steroid preparation through a needle placed in a\\nvein (intravenous or IV). Dehydration and salt loss will\\nalso be treated by administering carefully balanced solu-\\ntions through the IV . Dangerously low blood pressure\\nmay require special medications to safely elevate it until\\nthe steroids take effect.\\nPatients with Addison’s disease will need to take a\\nsteroid preparation (hydrocortisone) and a replacement\\nfor aldosterone (fludrocortisone) by mouth for the rest of\\ntheir lives. When a patient has an illness which causes\\nnausea and vomiting (such that they cannot hold down\\ntheir medications), he or she will need to enter a medical\\nfacility where IV medications can be administered.\\nWhen a patient has any kind of infection or injury, the\\nnormal dose of hydrocortisone will need to be doubled.\\nPrognosis\\nPrognosis for patients appropriately treated with\\nhydrocortisone and aldosterone is excellent.

       " 'Description\\nLocated at the back of the mouth above and below\\nthe soft palate are two pairs of lymph glands. The tonsils\\nbelow are clearly visible behind the back teeth; the ade-\\nnoids lie just above them and are hidden from view by the\\npalate. Together these four arsenals of immune defense\\nguard the major entrance to the body from foreign\\ninvaders—the germs we breathe and eat. In contrast to the\\nrest of the body’s tissues, lymphoid tissue reaches its\\ngreatest size in mid-childhood and recedes thereafter. In\\nthis way children are best able to develop the immunities\\nthey need to survive in a world full of infectious diseases.\\nBeyond its normal growth pattern, lymphoid tissue\\ngrows excessively (hypertrophies) during an acute infec-\\ntion, as it suddenly increases its immune activity to fight\\noff the invaders. Often it does not completely return to its\\nformer size. Each subsequent infection leaves behind a\\nlarger set of tonsils and adenoids. To make matters',\n",

Less often, the hypertrophy is due to repeated throat\\ninfections by cold viruses, strep throat, mononucleosis,\\nand in times gone by, diphtheria . The acute infections\\nare usually referred to as tonsillitis, the adenoids getting\\nlittle recognition because they cannot be seen without\\nspecial instruments. Symptoms include painful, bright\\nred, often ulcerated tonsils, enlargement of lymph nodes\\n(glands) beneath the jaw,fever, and general discomfort.\\nAfter the acute infection subsides, symptoms are gen-\\nerated simply by the size of the glands.

Occasionally, adrenalectomy may be recom-\\nmended when hormones produced by the adrenal glands\\naggravate another condition such as breast cancer.\\nPrecautions\\nThe adrenal glands are fed by numerous blood ves-\\nsels, so surgeons need to be alert to extensive bleeding\\nduring surgery.

Some-\\ntimes a vertical incision in the middle of the abdomen\\nprovides a better approach, especially if both adrenal\\nglands are involved.\\nIn the posterior approach, the surgeon cuts into the\\nback, just beneath the rib cage. If both glands are to be\\nremoved, an incision is made on each side of the body.\\nThis approach is the most direct route to the adrenal\\nglands, but it does not provide quite as clear a view of the\\nsurrounding structures as the anterior approach.\\nIn the flank approach, the surgeon cuts into the\\npatient’s side. This is particularly useful in massively obese\\npatients. If both glands need to be removed, the surgeon\\nmust remove one gland, repair the surgical wound, turn the\\npatient onto the other side, and repeat the entire process.\\nThe last approach involves an incision into the chest\\ncavity, either with or without part of the incision into the\\nabdominal cavity. It is used when the surgeon anticipates',\n",

ARDS is not itself a specific disease, but a syn-\\ndrome, a group of symptoms and signs that make up one\\nof the most important forms of lung or respiratory fail-\\nure. It can develop quite suddenly in persons whose\\nlungs have been perfectly normal. Very often ARDS is a',\n",
       " 'true medical emergency. The basic fault is a breakdown\\nof the barrier, or membrane, that normally keeps fluid\\nfrom leaking out of the small blood vessels of the lung\\ninto the breathing sacs (the alveoli).\\nDescription\\nAnother name for ARDS is shock lung. Its formal\\nname is misleading, because children, as well as adults,\\nmay be affected. In the lungs the smallest blood vessels,\\nor capillaries, make contact with the alveoli, tiny air sacs\\nat the tips of the smallest breathing tubes (the bronchi).\\nThis is the all-important site where oxygen passes from\\nair that is inhaled to the blood, which carries it to all parts\\nof the body. Any form of lung injury that damages this\\npoint of contact, called the alveolo-capillary junction,\\nwill allow blood and tissue fluid to leak into the alveoli,\\neventually filling them so that air cannot enter. The result\\nis the type of breathing distress called ARDS. ARDS is\\none of the major causes of excess fluid in the lungs, the\\nother being heart failure.',\n",
       " 'other being heart failure.\\nAlong with fluid there is a marked increase in\\ninflamed cells in the lungs. There also is debris left over\\nfrom damaged lung cells, and fibrin, a semi-solid materi-\\nal derived from blood in the tissues. Typically these\\nmaterials join together with large molecules in the blood\\n(proteins), to form hyaline membranes. (These mem-\\nbranes are very prominent in premature infants who\\ndevelop respiratory distress syndrome; it is often called\\nhyaline membrane disease.) If ARDS is very severe or\\nlasts a long time, the lungs do not heal, but rather become\\nscarred, a process known as fibrosis. The lack of a nor-\\nmal amount of oxygen causes the blood vessels of the\\nlung to become narrower, and in time they, too, may\\nbecome scarred and filled with clotted blood. The lungs\\nas a whole become very “stiff,” and it becomes much\\nharder for the patient to breathe.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nA very wide range of diseases or toxic substances,',\n",
       " 'including some drugs, can cause ARDS. They include:\\n• Breathing in (aspiration) of the stomach contents when\\nregurgitated, or salt water or fresh water from nearly\\ndrowning.\\n• Inhaling smoke, as in a fire; toxic materials in the air,\\nsuch as ammonia or hydrocarbons; or too much oxy-\\ngen, which itself can injure the lungs.\\n• Infection by a virus or bacterium, or sepsis, a wide-\\nspread infection that gets into the blood.\\n• Massive trauma, with severe injury to any part of the\\nbody.\\n• Shock with persistently low blood pressure may not in\\nitself cause ARDS, but it can be an important factor.\\n• A blood clotting disorder called disseminated intravas-\\ncular coagulation, in which blood clots form in vessels\\nthroughout the body, including the lungs.\\n• A large amount of fat entering the circulation and trav-\\neling to the lungs, where it lodges in small blood ves-\\nsels, injuring the cells lining the vessel walls.\\n• An overdose of a narcotic drug, a sedative, or, rarely,\\naspirin.',\n",

Changes in\\nthe make-up of the connective tissue alter the stability\\nof body structures, causing a loss of elasticity and func-\\ntioning, and leading to symptoms of aging.\\n• Free-radical theory. The most commonly held theory of\\naging, it is based on the fact that ongoing chemical\\nreactions of the cells produce free radicals. In the pres-\\nence of oxygen, these free radicals cause the cells of the\\nbody to break down. As time goes on, more cells die or\\nlose the ability to function, and the body soon ceases to\\nfunction as a whole.\\n• Immunological theory. There are changes in the immune\\nsystem as it begins to wear out, and the body is more\\nprone to infections and tissue damage, which may finally',\n",

In AIDS, immunodeficiency\\nresults from the way that the virus binds to a protein called\\nCD4, which is primarily found on the surface of certain\\nsubtypes of white blood cells called helper T cells or CD4\\ncells. After the virus has attached to the CD4 receptor, the',\n",

Because the immune system\\ncells are destroyed, many different types of infections\\nand cancers that take advantage of a person’s weakened\\nimmune system (opportunistic) can develop.\\nAutoimmunity is a condition in which the body’s\\nimmune system produces antibodies that work against its\\nown cells. Antibodies are specific proteins produced in\\nresponse to exposure to a specific, usually foreign, protein\\nor particle called an antigen. In this case, the body pro-\\nduces antibodies that bind to blood platelets that are nec-\\nessary for proper blood clotting and tissue repair. Once\\nbound, the antibodies mark the platelets for removal from\\nthe body, and they are filtered out by the spleen. Some\\nAIDS patients develop a disorder, called immune-related',\n",

Acute retroviral syndrome develops between\\none and six weeks after infection and lasts for two to\\nthree weeks. Blood tests during this period will indicate\\nthe presence of virus (viremia) and the appearance of the\\nviral p24 antigen in the blood.\\nLatency period\\nAfter the HIV virus enters a patient’s lymph nodes\\nduring the acute retroviral syndrome stage, the disease\\nbecomes latent for as many as 10 years or more before\\nsymptoms of advanced disease develop.

Many patients will\\ndevelop low-grade fevers, chronic fatigue, and general\\nweakness. HIV may also cause a combination of food\\nmalabsorption, loss of appetite, and increased metabo-\\nlism that contribute to the so-called AIDS wasting or\\nwasting syndrome.\\nOTHER ORGAN SYSTEMS. At any time during the\\ncourse of HIV infection, patients may suffer from a yeast\\ninfection in the mouth called thrush, open sores or ulcers,\\nor other infections of the mouth; diarrhea and other gas-\\ntrointestinal symptoms that cause malnutrition and\\nweight loss; diseases of the lungs and kidneys; and\\ndegeneration of the nerve fibers in the arms and legs.\\nHIV infection of the nervous system leads to general loss',\n",

These\\ntests are sometimes called AIDS serology tests. Serology\\nis the branch of immunology that deals with the contents\\nand characteristics of blood serum. Serum is the clear light\\nyellow part of blood that remains liquid when blood cells\\nform a clot. AIDS serology evaluates the presence of\\nhuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in blood\\nserum and its effects on each patient’s immune system.\\nPurpose\\nAIDS serology serves several different purposes.\\nSome AIDS tests are used to diagnose patients or con-\\nfirm a diagnosis; others are used to measure the progres-\\nsion of the disease or the effectiveness of specific treat-',\n",
       " 'ment regimens. Some AIDS tests can also be used to\\nscreen blood donations for safe use in transfusions.\\nIn order to understand the different purposes of the\\nblood tests used with AIDS patients, it is helpful to\\nunderstand how HIV infection affects human blood and\\nthe immune system. HIV is a retrovirus that enters the\\nblood stream of a new host in the following ways:\\n• by sexual contact\\n• by contact with infected body fluids (such as blood and\\nurine)\\n• by transmission during pregnancy,o r\\n• through transfusion of infected blood products\\nA retrovirus is a virus that contains a unique enzyme\\ncalled reverse transcriptase that allows it to replicate with-\\nin new host cells. The virus binds to a protein called CD4,\\nwhich is found on the surface of certain subtypes of white\\nblood cells, including helper T cells, macrophages, and\\nmonocytes. Once HIV enters the cell, it can replicate and\\nkill the cell in ways that are still not completely under-',\n",
       " 'stood. In addition to killing some lymphocytes directly, the\\nAIDS virus disrupts the functioning of the remaining CD4\\ncells. CD4 cells ordinarily produce a substance called\\ninterleukin-2 (IL-2), which stimulates other cells (T cells\\nand B cells) in the human immune system to respond to\\ninfections. Without the IL-2, T cells do not reproduce as\\nthey normally would in response to the HIV virus, and B\\ncells are not stimulated to respond to the infection.\\nPrecautions\\nIn some states such as New York, a signed consent\\nform is needed in order to administer an AIDS test. As\\nwith all blood tests, healthcare professionals should\\nalways wear latex gloves and to avoid being pricked by\\nthe needle used in drawing blood for the tests. Also, it\\nmay be difficult to get blood from a habitual intravenous\\ndrug user due to collapsed veins.\\nDescription\\nDiagnostic tests\\nDiagnostic blood tests for AIDS are usually given to\\npersons in high-risk populations who may have been',\n",
       " 'exposed to HIV or who have the early symptoms of\\nAIDS. Most persons infected with HIV will develop a\\ndetectable level of antibody within three months of infec-\\ntion. The condition of testing positive for HIV antibody\\nin the blood is called seroconversion, and persons who\\nhave become HIV-positive are called seroconverters.\\nIt is possible to diagnose HIV infection by isolating\\nthe virus itself from a blood sample or by demonstrating\\nthe presence of HIV antigen in the blood. Viral culture,\\nhowever, is expensive, not widely available, and slow—it\\ntakes 28 days to complete the viral culture test. More\\ncommon are blood tests that work by detecting the pres-\\nence of antibodies to the HIV virus. These tests are inex-\\npensive, widely available, and accurate in detecting\\n99.9% of AIDS infections when used in combination to\\nscreen patients and confirm diagnoses.\\nENZYME-LINKED IMMUNOSORBENT ASSAY (ELISA).\\nThis type of blood test is used to screen blood for trans-',\n",

A sample of the patient’s blood serum is added,\\nand excess proteins are removed. A second antibody cou-\\npled to an enzyme is added, followed by addition of a\\nsubstance that will cause the enzyme to react by forming\\na color. An instrument called a spectrophotometer can\\nmeasure the color. The name of the test is derived from\\nthe use of the enzyme that is coupled or linked to the sec-\\nond antibody.\\nThe latest generation of ELISA tests are 99.5% sen-\\nsitive to HIV . Occasionally, the ELISA test will be posi-\\ntive for a patient without symptoms of AIDS from a low-\\nrisk group. Because this result is likely to be a false-posi-\\ntive, the ELISA must be repeated on the same sample of\\nthe patient’s blood. If the second ELISA is positive, the\\nresult should be confirmed by the Western blot test.\\nWESTERN BLOT (IMMUNOBLOT). The Western blot',\n",

Also, patients with normal, or declining,\\nALT levels may experience serious liver damage without\\nan increase in ALT.\\nNevertheless, ALT is widely used, and useful,\\nbecause ALT levels are elevated in most patients with\\nliver disease. Although ALT levels do not necessarily\\nindicate the severity of the damage to the liver, they may\\nindicate how much of the liver has been damaged. ALT\\nlevels, when compared to the levels of a similar enzyme,\\naspartate aminotransferase (AST), may provide impor-\\ntant clues to the nature of the liver disease. For example,\\nwithin a certain range of values, a ratio of 2:1 or greater\\nfor AST: ALT might indicate that a patient suffers from\\nalcoholic liver disease. Other diagnostic data may be\\ngleaned from ALT tests to indicate abnormal results.\\nPreparation\\nNo special preparations are necessary for this test.\\nAftercare\\nThis test involves blood being drawn, probably from',\n",

       " 'of patients who have B-cell chronic lymphocytic\\nleukemia (B-CLL).\\nPurpose\\nAlemtuzumab is a monoclonal antibody used to treat\\nB-CLL, one of the most prevalent forms of adult chronic\\nleukemia. It specifically binds CD52, a protein found on\\nthe surface of essentially all B and T cells of the immune\\nsystem. By binding the CD52 protein on the malignant B\\ncells, the antibody targets it for removal from the circula-\\ntion. Scientists believe that alemtuzumab triggers anti-\\nbody-mediated lysis of the B cells, a method that the\\nimmune system uses to eliminate foreign cells.\\nAlemtuzumab has been approved by the FDA for\\ntreatment of refractory B-CLL. For a patient’s disease to\\nbe classified as refractory, both alkylating agents and flu-\\ndarabine treatment must have been tried and failed. Thus,\\nthis drug gives patients who have tried all approved treat-\\nments for B-CLL another option. As most patients with\\nB-CLL are in stage III or IV by the time both alkylating',\n",

The human sequences also help to\\nensure that the various cell-destroying mechanisms of\\nthe human immune system are properly triggered with\\nbinding of the antibody.\\nAlemtuzumab was approved in May of 2001 for the\\ntreatment of refractory B-CLL.

When the\\ndoctor admitted that he didn’t know what Alexander was\\ndoing to injure his vocal chords, Alexander decided to try\\nand find out for himself.\\nThus began a decade of self-observation and discov-\\nery. Using as many as three mirrors to observe himself in\\nthe act of reciting, normal speaking, and later standing,\\nwalking, and sitting, Alexander managed to improve his\\ncoordination and to overcome his vocal problems. One of\\nhis most startling discoveries was that in order to change\\nthe way he used his body he had to change the way he\\nwas thinking, redirecting his thoughts in such a way that\\nhe did not produce unnecessary tension when he attempt-\\ned speech or movement. After making this discovery at\\nthe end of the nineteenth century, Alexander became a\\npioneer in body-mind medicine.\\nAt first, performers and dancers sought guidance\\nfrom Alexander to overcome physical complaints and',\n",

Pri-\\nvate lessons range from a half-hour to an hour in length,\\nand are taught in a series. The number of lessons varies\\naccording to the severity of the student’s difficulties\\nwith coordination or to the extent of the student’s inter-\\nest in pursuing the improvements made possible by con-\\ntinued study.

At the beginning of a move-\\nment (the lessons are a series of movements), most\\npeople pull back their heads, raise their shoulders\\ntoward their ears, over-arch their lower backs, tighten\\ntheir legs, and otherwise produce excessive tension in\\ntheir bodies.

The end product of\\nthis reaction is measured; and from that measurement,\\nthe amount of alkaline phosphatase in the person’s serum\\nis determined.\\nEach tissue—liver, bone, placenta, and intestine—\\nproduces a slightly different alkaline phosphatase. These\\nvariations are called isoenzymes. In the laboratory, alka-\\nline phosphatase is measured as the total amount or the\\namount of each of the the four isoenzymes. The isoen-\\nzymes react differently to heat, certain chemicals, and\\nother processes in the laboratory. Methods to measure\\nthem separately are based on these differences.\\nThe test is covered by insurance when medically\\nnecessary. Results are usually available the next day.\\nPreparation\\nTo collect the 5-10 ml blood needed for this test, a\\nhealthcare worker ties a tourniquet on the person’s upper\\narm, locates a vein in the inner elbow region, and inserts\\na needle into that vein.

ABPA is a hypersensitivity reaction\\nthat occurs in asthma patients who are allergic to this\\nspecific fungus.\\nDescription\\nABPA is an allergic reaction to a species of\\nAspergillus called Aspergillus fumigatus. It is sometimes\\ngrouped together with other lung disorders characterized\\nby eosinophilia—an abnormal increase of a certain type\\nof white blood cell in the blood—under the heading of',\n",
       " 'eosinophilic pneumonia. These disorders are also called\\nhypersensitivity lung diseases.\\nABPA appears to be increasing in frequency in the\\nUnited States, although the reasons for the increase are not\\nclear. The disorder is most likely to occur in adult asthmat-\\nics aged 20-40. It affects males and females equally.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nABPA develops when the patient breathes air con-\\ntaining Aspergillus spores. These spores are found\\nworldwide, especially around riverbanks, marshes, bogs,\\nforests, and wherever there is wet or decaying vegetation.\\nThey are also found on wet paint, construction materials,\\nand in air conditioning systems. ABPA is a nosocomial\\ninfection, which means that a patient can get it in a hos-\\npital. When Aspergillus spores reach the bronchi, which\\nare the branches of the windpipe that lead into the lungs,\\nthe bronchi react by contracting spasmodically. So the\\npatient has difficulty breathing and usually wheezes or\\ncoughs. Many patients with ABPA also run a low-grade',\n",
       " 'fever and lose their appetites.\\nComplications\\nPatients with ABPA sometimes cough up large\\namounts of blood, a condition that is called hemoptysis.\\nThey may also develop a serious long-term form of\\nbronchiectasis , the formation of fibrous tissue in the\\nlungs. Bronchiectasis is a chronic bronchial disorder\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 107\\nAllergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 107caused by repeated inflammation of the airway, and\\nmarked by the abnormal enlargement of, or damage to,\\nthe bronchial walls. ABPA sometimes occurs as a com-\\nplication of cystic fibrosis.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe diagnosis of ABPA is based on a combination of\\nthe patient’s history and the results of blood tests, sputum\\ntests, skin tests, and diagnostic imaging. The doctor will\\nbe concerned to distinguish between ABPA and a wors-\\nening of the patient’s asthma, cystic fibrosis, or other\\nlung disorders. There are seven major criteria for a diag-',\n",
       " 'nosis of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis:\\n• a history of asthma.\\n• an accumulation of fluid in the lung that is visible on a\\nchest x ray.\\n• bronchiectasis (abnormal stretching, enlarging, or\\ndestruction of the walls of the bronchial tubes).\\n• skin reaction to Aspergillus antigen.\\n• eosinophilia in the patient’s blood and sputum.\\n• Aspergillus precipitins in the patient’s blood. Precip-\\nitins are antibodies that react with the antigen to form a\\nsolid that separates from the rest of the solution in the\\ntest tube.\\n• a high level of IgE in the patient’s blood. IgE refers to a\\nclass of antibodies in blood plasma that activate allergic\\nreactions to foreign particles.\\nOther criteria that may be used to support the diag-\\nnosis include the presence of Aspergillus in samples of\\nthe patient’s sputum, the coughing up of plugs of brown\\nmucus, or a late skin reaction to the Aspergillus antigen.\\nLaboratory tests\\nThe laboratory tests that are done to obtain this',\n",
       " 'The laboratory tests that are done to obtain this\\ninformation include a complete blood count (CBC), a\\nsputum culture , a blood serum test of IgE levels, and\\na skin test for the Aspergillus antigen. In the skin test, a\\nsmall amount of antigen is injected into the upper layer\\nof skin on the patient’s forearm about four inches\\nbelow the elbow. If the patient has a high level of IgE\\nantibodies in the tissue, he or she will develop what is\\ncalled a “wheal and flare” reaction in about 15-20 min-\\nutes. A “wheal and flare” reaction is characterized by\\nthe eruption of a reddened, itching spot on the skin.\\nSome patients with ABPA will develop the so-called\\nlate reaction to the skin test, in which a red, sore,\\nswollen area develops about six to eight hours after the\\ninitial reaction.\\nAspergillus can sometimes be seen under a micro-\\nscope slide made from the patient’s sputum, but the diag-\\nnosis is considered definite only when the fungus is cul-',\n",
       " 'tured in the laboratory. Aspergillus is easy to culture, and\\ncan be identified when it is stained with periodic acid-\\nSchiff (PAS), Calcofluor, or potassium hydroxide (KOH)\\npreparations.\\nDiagnostic imaging\\nChest x rays and CT scans are used to check for the\\npresence of fluid accumulation in the lungs and signs of\\nbronchiectasis.\\nTreatment\\nABPA is usually treated with prednisone (Meti-\\ncorten) or other corticosteroids taken by mouth, and\\nwith bronchodilators.\\nAntifungal drugs are not used to treat ABPA because\\nit is caused by an allergic reaction to Aspergillus rather\\nthan by direct infection of tissue.\\nFollow-up care\\nPatients with ABPA should be given periodic\\ncheckups with chest x rays and a spirometer test. A\\nspirometer is an instrument that evaluates the patient’s\\nlung capacity.\\nPrognosis\\nMost patients with ABPA respond well to corticos-\\nteroid treatment. Others have a chronic course with grad-\\nual improvement over time. The best indicator of a good',\n",
       " 'prognosis is a long-term fall in the patient’s IgE level.\\nPatients with lung complications from ABPA may devel-\\nop severe airway obstruction.\\nPrevention\\nABPA is difficult to prevent because Aspergillus is a\\ncommon fungus; it can be found in the saliva and sputum\\nof most healthy individuals. Patients with ABPA can pro-\\ntect themselves somewhat by avoiding haystacks, com-\\npost piles, bogs, marshes, and other locations with wet or\\nrotting vegetation; by avoiding construction sites or\\nnewly painted surfaces; and by having their air condi-\\ntioners cleaned regularly.
